# To clone a directory

		git clone https://yourRemoteRepositoryUrl

		it may prompt you for your user name and password

# if you created a new git directory (folder), you will need to navigate to the diretory and type: 

		git init

# next you will need to do a pull down of the latest code:

		git pull


# to see a history of git commits use git log:

		git log 


# if you need to check if you have file changes "staged" but not commited yet, use git status:

		git status


# before you can commit changes, you have to "stage" (add) your files:

### to "stage" individual files that were changed

		git add [filepath] # This adds an individual file

### to "stage" "All" files in the directory that have changes ---- most all of the time this is what we will use 


		git add . 		# This adds all files with changes

		or

		git add --all

# Once you have staged your files, you can then commit them

		git commit -m "Your notes and comments about your commit"

# you should be able checked the files that are staged again

		git status

# now you should be able to push your changes to GitHub

		git push
